## Usage

Tests need a config file to be generated first via the `scripts/applicationConf.sh` script. Make sure you edit all the
config values accordingly.

Common test classes are in `scr/main/scala/test` package and can/should be used (extended) in your project.

## Play Framework

This project doesn't use the Play plugin directly to not interfere with Play enabled apps that use this project as a
dependancy. It rather depends on Play artifacts directly and uses a [custom router](test/scala/RequestHandler) for tests.
